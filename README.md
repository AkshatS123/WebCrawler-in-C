# WebCrawler-Sharma
Developed a high-performance web crawler in C, designed to navigate and extract valuable information from websites. This efficient crawler employs multi-threading to enhance traversal speed and optimize resource utilization. By parsing HTML content, it systematically collects data according to predefined patterns or keywords. With its scalability, compliance with web standards, and comprehensive logging, this C-based web crawler showcases my expertise in developing reliable and efficient software solutions for data extraction from the web.

Key Achievements:

Designed a scalable architecture for the web crawler, optimizing resource utilization and minimizing memory footprint.
Implemented advanced algorithms for URL parsing, ensuring accurate and efficient traversal of web pages.
Developed intelligent content filtering mechanisms to extract specific data based on defined patterns or keywords.
Incorporated multi-threading and asynchronous processing to enhance performance and expedite data retrieval.
Implemented error handling and recovery mechanisms to handle network interruptions, timeouts, and website errors gracefully.
Integrated robust logging and reporting functionalities to track crawler activity and identify potential issues.
Ensured compliance with web standards and policies, including adherence to robots.txt directives and respecting website crawl rate limits.
Conducted comprehensive testing and debugging to eliminate potential bugs and improve overall reliability and stability.
Technologies Used:

C programming language
HTML parsing libraries (e.g., libxml2, Gumbo)
Multi-threading libraries (e.g., pthreads)
Networking libraries (e.g., libcurl)
Regular expressions for pattern matching
